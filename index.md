Hello, welcome to my blog. My name is Ashine Dissanayake and the intended purpose of this blog is to outline my learning journey through fast.ai. 

## <span style="color: rgb(84, 164, 162)">What is fast.ai?</span>
Fast.ai is an **open-source deep learning library** and an online course created by Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas. The library is built on top of **PyTorch** and provides a high-level API for **training** and **deploying deep learning models**. The course is designed to teach practical deep learning to developers, researchers, as well as an opportunity to apply machine learning models to real-world problems. Refer to [fast.ai Homepage](https://www.fast.ai) for more information on fast.ai.

## <span style="color: rgb(84, 164, 162)">Overview</span> 
The module that I will be covering is **Practical Deep Learning** that teaches how to apply machine learning and deep learning techniques to problems. THe course highlights the following concepts. 
<ul>
  <li>Build and train different deep learning models used for computer vision, natural learning processing, tabular analysis and collaborative filtering problems. </li>
  <li>Learn and apply random forest and regression models. </li>
  <li>Apply models in real life problems. </li>
  <li>Documentation and exploration on PyTorch. </li>
</ul>
