# **Chapter 1:** Getting Started

## Setting up Kaggle 
Kaggle provides a platform for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and other practitioners to collaborate and compete on solving complex data science problems. 

## Video Notes
<ul>
  <li>Ran through bird vs forest model. </li>
  <li> Creating images from video prompts using DALLÂ·E 2</li>
  <li> Google AI Blog</li>
  <li> Data Ethics</li>
  <li> Can find features in images. More images you provide the better the result will be. How neural network can acheive this. </li>
  <li> Image recoiser than be user to identify sounds. Create pictures from waveforms. Take time series and turn into pictures. </li>
  <li> Dont need math. Dont need data (we've seen record breaking results with <50 items of data). Don't need lots of expensive compiters. </li>
  <li> Using PyTorch. Tensor flow is dying in popularity nad PyToarch is growing rapidly. </li>
  <li> Using Juypter Notebook  on a cloud sever. </li>
  <li> Resize because it might take too much processing time. </li>
  <li> Fastai won't run if you dont provide a dataset.</li>
  <li> Everyhitng must be the same size. </li>  
  <li> for functions to use have a look at datablock. </li>
  <li> Segmentation. Colour in pixels for seperate entities. </li>  
  <li> Table analysis. </li>  
  <li> Collaborating filtering: Which uses use which products. And you use that to find other things similar users might like.  </li>
  <li> Valid loss = mean quare error. </li>  
  <li> A normal computer program. Program contains all the fancy stuff. A achine learning model contrains inputs weight as inputs, the model and the output is result.  An addition tot eh results is the loss which will get fed back into the model and update the weights.</li>  
  <li> Valid loss = mean quare error. </li>  
  <li> Valid loss = mean quare error. </li>
